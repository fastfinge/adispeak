alpha 0.1

-- First release

alpha 0.1.1

-- Fix some hardcoded paths preventing the client from running at all

Alpha 0.1.2

-- add missing spaces in some messages (thanks arfy)

Alpha 0.1.3

-- Added an app config for those running as admin or without UAC (thanks byron)

Alpha 0.1.4

-- Make the changelog public
-- added /sapion command to force use of SAPI, and /sapioff to go back to screen reader. This setting is not saved when the client is restarted. It's just a quick skeleton feature for people who want it (looking at you, Robert).
-- announce the window name when entering a new window with control tab (thanks groundplane)
-- get the version info out of the title bar, and remove an inaccessible icon from the menubar
-- make messages less verbose in the currently active window (for example, don't announce "fastfinge in #blind says" when #blind is the active window. Instead just "fastfinge says")

Alpha 0.1.4.1

-- Whenever you use the GUI, all paths become full rather than relative. Fixed them again.

Alpha 0.1.5

upgrading:

If you don't want to lose all of your settings, copy plugins\adispeak.dll, AdiIRC.exe, and history.mrc into your existing AdiIRC folder.

-- autocomplete now reads on tab
-- shift+c to copy a message to the clipboard from the f6 history window now works (thanks arfy)
-- sapion and sapioff now give feedback
-- the options list and server list now read (thanks Per Amundsen)
-- New way of reviewing history, without opening a new window or pressing f6: alt+shift+up arrow for previous line, alt+shift+down arrow for next line, and control+shift+c to copy current history line to clipboard. This should sync with the scrollbar for sighted users.
